## Assumptions 
1. The short-id module will take care of creating shortcodes and the probabibilty of collision with this plugin is low. 
It would be better to build that ground up. 



## Things I would have liked to improve.
1. Write my own css instead of using bootstrap. 
2. Write tests to send  get and post requests. Now the tests only test the db. 
3. Add expiry date to the Schema of the db and return that to the user. It would also help to do weekly db clean ups.  
4.Would have liked to make an ajax request. 
5. The first test on tests/test-pages.js seems to error out on some later versions of node. I was unable to replicate the issue so that test has been commented out for now.
