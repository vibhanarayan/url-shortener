1. I have used bootstrap to build a responsive site but also wrote my own css. 
2. I have only written unit tests to test the db but not for the get and post requests 
3. I would also have liked to change the Schema of the db to store an expiry date too and return that to the user. 
4. The copy button is a little glitchy- It copies the link to a text area and appends that to the body of the page. 
5. Would have liked to make an ajax request. 
6. There's an overflow in the page if the user's long URL is very long
